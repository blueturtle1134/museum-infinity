# museum-infinity

This is an unconventional Minecraft modpack set in a mysterious, abandoned structure - the titular Infinite Museum.

## Installing

I'll eventually put it on some kind of modpack loader, but for now, if you want to contribute or test:

- Download latest Forge for 1.12
- Clone repository
- Create new Minecraft launch profile for Forge 1.12 and use the repository location as the folder
- Launch once to initialize everything
- Copy the mods zip file into the mods folder
