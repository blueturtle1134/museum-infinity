uaHierarchy used to determine random splittings:

List SPLITS_NodeshellList contains only COMMON_Nodeshell

COMMON_Nodeshell waits for a player to approach, then spawns in SPLITS_NodeshellList to the four sides and spawns in SPLITS_Chunk

List SPLITS_Chunk represents an entire bedrock-to-ground column of 42x42. It only contains structure COMMON_Chunkshell

List SPLITS_Max includes structure SPLITS_Max_UD only (more will be added later) which splits it into two of SPLITS_Full
List SPLITS_Top acts like SPLITS_Full for now and includes SPLITS_End_Full only
List SPLITS_Bottom acts like SPLITS_Full for now and includes SPLITS_End_Full only

SPLITS_End_Full generates SPLITS_Full

List SPLITS_Full includes structures COMMON_Fullshell, SPLITS_Full_UD, SPLITS_Full_NS, and SPLITS_Full_EW
COMMON_Fullshell is in list SPLITS_Full and generates one from ROOMS_Full
SPLITS_Full_UD is in list SPLITS_Full and generates two from SPLITS_Flat
SPLITS_Full_NS is in list SPLITS_Full and generates two from SPLITS_HalfNS
SPLITS_Full_EW is in list SPLITS_Full and generates two from SPLITS_HalfEW

List SPLITS_Flat includes structures COMMON_Flatshell, SPLITS_Flat_NS, and SPLITS_Flat_EW
COMMON_Flatshell is in list SPLITS_Flat and generates one from ROOMS_Flat
SPLITS_Flat_NS is in list SPLITS_Flat and generates two from SPLITS_QuadEW
SPLITS_Flat_EW is in list SPLITS_Flat and generates two from SPLITS_QuadNS

List SPLITS_HalfNS includes structures COMMON_HalfNSShell, SPLITS_HalfNS_EW, and SPLITS_HalfNS_UD
COMMON_HalfNSShell is in list SPLITS_HalfNS and generates one from ROOMS_HalfNS
SPLITS_HalfNS_EW is in list SPLITS_HalfNS and generates two from SPLITS_Tall
SPLITS_HalfNS_UD is in list SPLITS_HalfNS and generates two from SPLITS_QuadEW

List SPLITS_HalfEW includes structures COMMON_HalfEWShell, SPLITS_HalfEW_NS, and SPLITS_HalfEW_UD
COMMON_HalfEWShell is in list SPLITS_HalfEW and generates one from ROOMS_HalfEW
SPLITS_HalfEW_NS is in list SPLITS_HalfEW and generates two from SPLITS_Tall
SPLITS_HalfEW_UD is in list SPLITS_HalfEW and generates two from SPLITS_QuadNS

List SPLITS_QuadNS includes structures COMMON_QuadNSShell and SPLITS_QuadNS_Small
COMMON_QuadNSShell is in list SPLITS_QuadNS and generates one from ROOMS_QuadNS
SPLITS_QuadNS_Small is in list SPLITS_QuadNS and generates two from ROOMS_Small

List SPLITS_QuadEW includes structures COMMON_QuadEWShell and SPLITS_QuadEW_Small
COMMON_QuadEWShell is in list SPLITS_QuadEW and generates one from ROOMS_QuadEW
SPLITS_QuadEW_Small is in list SPLITS_QuadEW and generates two from ROOMS_Small

List SPLITS_Tall includes structures COMMON_TallShell and SPLITS_Tall_Small
COMMON_TallShell is in list SPLITS_Tall and generates one from ROOMS_Tall
SPLITS_Tall_Small is in list SPLITS_Tall and generates two from ROOMS_Small
